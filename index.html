      Information technology means the study or use of electronic equipment,
      especially computers, for storing, analyzing and distributing information
      of all kinds. Information technology is the need of the hour and its
      significance will increase all the more in future. It has made our access
      to knowledge easier. It has become part and parcel of the modern world. In
      Pakistan, information technology was introduced on a limited scale, but
      soon it became the need of everybody. Now almost every literate person,
      student, scholar, businessman, doctor and government official is enjoying
      the benefits of information technology. “Information technology and
      businesss are become inextricably interwoven. I don’t think anybody can
      talk meaningfully about one without talking about the other”. (Bill Gates)
      Today’s world is changing fast and shaping a new. Old trends are giving
      way to the new ones. Information technology has brought a revolution in
      the world. Mysteries are being resolved and puzzles are being solved with
      the help of information technology. People are becoming more and more
      aware of the world they live in. There is more enlightenment for people
      now than it was in the past. Information technology is now the order of
      the day. Latest techniques are being applied to get the maximum benefits
      from till. Now it is in the approach of all and sundry in Pakistan. We
      have realized that if we want to keep pace with the fast-changing world,
      information technology is the right area for us to progress. Now
      information about anything is within our reach. It has opened up a new
      world to us. “Information technology is at the core of how you do your
      business and how your business model itself evolves”. (Satya Nadella) It’s
      pretty incredible to look back 30 years when Microsoft was starting and
      realize how work has been transformed. We’re finally getting close to what
      I call the digital work style. The Internet has increased new
      opportunities for government, business, and education. Government use
      internet for internal communication and the distribution of information.
      Business offer goods and services to customers. Many people use internet
      for shopping, paying, bills and online banking. Educational institutions
      use the Internet for research purposes. They also deliver courses to
      students in remote areas. Apart from its negative uses, we can safely say
      that the future of information technology is very bright in Pakistan. It
      is doing wonders to solve the problems like disease, poverty, backwardness
      and lawlessness. It will help our students to know about what has been
      unknown for a long time. It will improve our image in the community of the
      word. It will show the world that we are not a backward nation and we
      rightly deserve to be called a moderate and progressive nation.
      “Technology just means information Technology”. (Peter Thiel) The
      government in Pakistan is giving more and more incentives to encourage
      people in this field. It has tried to introduce it even in the small
      cities and villages. A sufficient portion of been specified for it. So, we
      can say that information technology is among the top priorities of the
      government. Information technology means the study or use of electronic

      drawbacks of technology can be seen in the following ways: 1. The use of
      mobiles was meant to be able to keep in touch in difficult times. But now
      we see kids too much involved in the different applications on mobiles and
      killing their valuable time. 2. Many crimes have been reported through the
      misuse of digital technology. 3. Also, it has been seen that many people
      lack the basic education required to ensure the proper use of the
      technology available today. In fact, most of them use it for the sake of
      fashion and hence end up misusing it. 4. People have been so dependent on
      technology that they no more want to do any kind of manual activity. Even
      for small works that can be done manually, people prefer to do it through
      technology. This has resulted in making humans mentally as well as
      physically dormant. “Technology just means information Technology”. (Peter

      So, we can say that information technology is among the top priorities of
      the government. Information technology is that technology by which the
      ‘nformation is processed, communicated, exhibited and Retrieved in a fast,
      error-free and proper-way. Information technology is a technology in which
      both telecommunication computer technologies work together to provide
      formation. Today’s world is the world of information and
      telecommunication. Everyday new technology and inventions are being made
      in the area of information, processing and travelling. There is hardly any
      area which had not been affected by this. Due to all this, the word
      distance sounds ironical in present day context. The whole world has
      become a small place today. Any information can be exchanged by people in
      few seconds and that, too, in proper and effective way without any loss of
      data while it is being processed. On the one hand, all these different
      ways of tele-communication and information exchage have highlighted the
      necessity for multipurpose development and growth of information
      technology and on the other, the easy access and use of it has boosted the
      network of information exchange. All this has been possible through
      information technology like telephone, fax, telex, computers, internet,
      e-mail, photocopier, printer, scanner, cellular phones, pagers,
      videophone, digital camera, multimedia, etc. These technologies are
      becoming a part and parcel of our lives and are transforming lifestyles
      and habits of people all over the world. The use of computers has
      increased by leaps and bounds worldwide. Internet and multimedia have now
      become playthings for children. The internet has revolutionized every
      field of the world. The government has allowed private companies to
      provide internet services to people in order to boost up information
      technology. The internet has put an unprecedented amount of buying and
      selling power in the hands of all those within a keystroke distance of a
      computer. Never in the history of commerce have solitary buyers and
      sellers been able to engage so effortlessly in commerce on all points
      whether one is a scrap dealer or a collector with an obsession for
      antiques, the internet is a solution. Digital technology is playing a
      vital role in our day to day life. In supermarkets it helps for faster
      processing of films. In the field of agriculture, a digital moisture meter
      records the moisture in the soil and tells when harvesting should start.
      For people, who are suffering from hearing loss, digits technology is of
      great help. It processes sounds that reduce noise, improves clarity of
      speech and controls unwanted loudness. Therefore, we hope that the
      positive uses of information technology will bring in progress and
      prosperity in our country. It can be a Messiah for the salvation of a
      nation from backwardness and ignorance. It can lead the people from the
      junk piles of ignorance to the highway of peace, progress and prosperity.
      “A fundamental rule in technology says that whatever can be done will be
      done”. Therefore, we hope that the positive uses of information technology
      will bring in progress and prosperity in our country. It can be a Messiah
      for the salvation of a nation from backwardness and ignorance. It can lead
      the people from the junk piles of ignorance to the highway of peace,
      progress and prosperity. “A fundamental rule in technology says that
      whatever can be done will be done”.
